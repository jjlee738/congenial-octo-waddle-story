 “How can I play tricks on people today?” 
‘Use a slingshot to break pots’, ‘hit a crying baby’, ‘pile drive all of the pumpkins’, 
‘Spoil something when all is going well’.... Nolbu’s grumpyness got worse everyday,
 which made his parents always worried.

However, Heungbu was nothing like his brother and would play happily with the other children from the village.
This made Nolbu grow with anger inside because he wanted to play too, but he was too mean. So, Nolbu was always 
scheming for the perfect way to ruin Heungbu's day. One normal day, Nolbu hatched the perfect plan. He decided 
he would steal the bracelet of the girl that he knew Heungbu liked and put it into Heungbu's bag. Once the girl
realized it was gone, Nolbu came forward and said that he saw Heungbu take the bracelet. He searched Heungbu's bag
infront of the girl and produced her bracelet. She was so was so happy that Nolbu had found the bracelet and was
very angry at Heungbu for taking it. She stopped spending time with Heungbu and started spending time with Nolbu.
