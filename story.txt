A Crow, ready to die with thirst, flew with joy to a Pitcher hoping to find some water in it. 
He found some there, to be sure, but only a little drop at the bottom, which he was quite unable to reach.
He then tried to overturn the Pitcher, but it was too heavy. 
So he gathered up some pebbles, with which the ground near was covered, and, taking them one by one in his beak, dropped them into the Pitcher.
By this means the water gradually reached the top, and he was able to drink at his case.
